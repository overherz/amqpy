AMQPy
=====

Lightweight AMQP framework built on top of the [php-amqp](https://github.com/pdezwart/php-amqp) extension.

Requirementes
-------------

 * [php-amqp](http://pecl.php.net/package/amqp) >= 1.4.0 (for now master branch only) (with [librabbitmq]() >= 0.4.1)

It is aimed to provide painless as much as possible AMQP integration in your applications.

You can find some examples in `/demo` folder but they are incomplete and non-documented now (and probably doesn't work now),
sorry guys.

If you have questions of feature request or even found a bug (wow! you are really awesome) please create an issue
or even send pull request or old-style patch.

*NOTE* demos are completely outdated

- [ ] - container and events support (should we? it may be done with inheritance and callbacks (before, after, etc.))
- [ ] - laravel bundle
