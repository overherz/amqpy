AMQPy
=====

Lightweight AMQP framework built on top of the [php-amqp](https://github.com/pdezwart/php-amqp) extension.

It is aimed to provide painless as much as possible AMQP integration in your applications.

You can find some examples in `/demo` folder but they are incomplete and non-documented now, sorry guys.

If you have questions of feature request or even found a bug please create an issue. 

*NOTE* demos are completely outdated

TODO
====

[x] - drop solutions support while they are too situation-specific
[x] - drop php < 5.5 support to use new features (final)
[ ] - update demo
[ ] - unit tests
[ ] - code coverage
